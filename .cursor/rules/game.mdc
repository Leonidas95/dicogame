# DicoGame - Core Game Mechanics

## Game Overview
**DicoGame** is a multiplayer word guessing game where players attempt to identify the correct definition of a real word without prior knowledge of its meaning.

## Game Objective
Players compete to either:
- Find the correct definition (earn 1 point)
- Fool other players with their fake definition (earn 1 point per vote received)

## Game Flow

### Round Structure
Each round follows this sequence:

1. **Word Display Phase**
   - The target word is displayed on screen
   - All players can see the word simultaneously

2. **Definition Writing Phase** (2 minutes)
   - Players write their proposed definition
   - One player writes the correct definition (system)
   - Other players write fake definitions
   - Timer ensures fair play

3. **Definition Review Phase**
   - All definitions are displayed in a list
   - Players cannot see who wrote which definition
   - Players cannot vote for their own definition

4. **Voting Phase**
   - Players vote for the definition they believe is correct
   - Each player gets one vote
   - Self-voting is prohibited

5. **Scoring Phase**
   - **Correct Definition Voters**: Earn 1 point each
   - **Fake Definition Authors**: Earn 1 point per vote received
   - Scores are updated and displayed

### Game Progression
- **Rounds**: Continue until predetermined number is reached
- **Game End**: Occurs when all rounds are completed or all players leave
- **Winner**: Player with the highest score at game end

## Scoring System

### Point Distribution
```typescript
// Example scoring logic
const calculateRoundScores = (votes: Vote[], definitions: Definition[]) => {
	votes.forEach(vote => {
		const definition = definitions.find(d => d.id === vote.definitionId);
		
		if (definition.isCorrect) {
			// Voter gets 1 point for finding correct definition
			addScore(vote.playerId, 1);
		} else {
			// Definition author gets 1 point for each vote received
			addScore(definition.playerId, 1);
		}
	});
};
```

### Victory Conditions
- **Primary**: Highest total score after all rounds
- **Tiebreaker**: Most correct definitions identified
- **Final Tiebreaker**: Most votes received on fake definitions

## Game Rules

### Player Actions
- **Definition Writing**: Must be completed within 2-minute time limit
- **Voting**: One vote per player per round
- **Self-Voting**: Strictly prohibited
- **Communication**: No external communication about definitions

### Fair Play
- **No External Resources**: Players cannot look up word definitions
- **Original Content**: Definitions must be original, not copied
- **Time Limits**: Strict enforcement of phase timers
- **Anonymous Voting**: Player identities hidden during voting

### Game State Management
- **Phase Transitions**: Automatic progression when conditions are met
- **Player Disconnection**: Graceful handling with reconnection support
- **State Persistence**: Game state saved for session recovery
- **Real-time Updates**: Live synchronization across all players
